# im_shelf

## About

A simple and elegant widget to display content such as an image within an animated
closable shelf.

## Description

A widget that contains items placed within a shelf. Every time an item is tapped
it expands to display its content. Any other items that were open prior to opening
a new item are closed automatically and tapping an item again closes the item as
well. The item opening and closing animation can be customized. Although,
typically designed to display images within the content of items, the content
can however hold any widget.
